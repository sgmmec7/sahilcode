1.) I can check the boat Status (a) CN - It means boat is booked
				(b) NC - It means boat is not booked

2.) I store customer name value from Session["UserId"] i.e. from user which is login.

3.) Status of boat booking is stored in tblRequest. By default status stored against each boat book data 
is "NC".
