1.) I use the following two status to track booking of boat 
(a) CN - It means boat is booked
(b) NC - It means boat is not booked

2.) I store customer name value from Session["UserId"] i.e. from user which is login.

3.) Status of boat booking is stored in tblRequest. By default status stored against each boat book data is "NC".
